# Inspiration
My friends and I communicate on Discord <i>a lot</i> and they absolutely love Pokemon, so I figured 'Why not create a Discord bot that allows them to interact with Pokemon?' Andddd that's exactly what I did. This is a more sophisticated project compared to my [First Discord Bot](https://github.com/Rick10101221/first_discord_bot), but by no means is it flushed out (or well-written). I currently have everything in a single index.js file and I have yet to find time to modularize and refactor it. 

# What It Does
Periodically sends Pokemon sprites to a specific Discord channel so that you can 'catch' them and add them to your Pokedex. I still have to implement the catching functionality, but other than that, this bot works flawlessly (if I do say so myself).

# What's Next for my Pokemon Bot
I really want to flush this out and add a server and database to this project. I think it would be really cool if you're actually able to catch a Pokemon and (hypothetically) store its meta-data and characteristics in a Pokedex of some sort. I would just have to initialize an instance of Firebase or attach a MongoDB cluster to the project and it should be good to go. Also accepting donations for this project as well thank you :)

# Tech Stack
- DiscordJS
- Node-Fetch (this doesn't even count)
- (Eventually) Firebase or MongoDB for User-Dependent Pokedex
